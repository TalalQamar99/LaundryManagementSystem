This repository contains the source files for my end semester project for the course 'Object Oriented Programming' . 
The coding and debugging was done in Visual Studio 2019 Community Version. 
## Concepts Involved
We used the concept of file handling for managing student records and admin finances. File handling is also used
for storing student login details. Other concepts used are Inheritance, Error Handling and Encapsulation. 
## Basic Functionality
The code implements typical laundry store management system in relation to the student Hostels. In student hostels
the laundry store can sometime become a messy business. Students sometime loose their clothes without any documented
record. This project aims to solve this problem.
## Admin Interface
The admin and his user name and password is hardcoded into the source code. The store owner or administrator can
login with his login credentials to create receipts, manage finances and keep a central database of all the orders
with their respective order data and time. 
## Student Interface
Students can register themselves in the system and obtain their login credentials. Afterwards they can track
their orders using these login details.
## Missing Functionality
Our initial plan involved a web application and mobile app to implement the discussed functionality. We also 
wanted to use encryption to store login credentials. However due to shortage of time we could not implement
these features. 
My initial plan was to use Smart Contracts for tracking order but it involed many complications which we beyond
the scope of my course.
